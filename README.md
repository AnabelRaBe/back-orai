# Orai

## Objective

The objective of this solution design is to carry out a product with Azure Open AI generative AI in order to test its capabilities with Santander public documentation.

The product aims to:

- Validate how generative AI works with Azure Open AI using public documentation about finance, corporative culture, strategies etc.
- Allow question/answer interaction, conversational history management, ingestion of documentation, exploration of ingested documentation and deletion of it.
- Use as base solution for different countries.

## About this solution

This project is designed to provide support and assistance to management teams and board members. Its objective is to provide answers to questions related to topics such as strategy, financial results, organizational structure, and corporate culture, among others.

This is a tool that combines the capabilities of Azure AI Search and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a conversational search experience. This solution accelerator uses an Azure OpenAI GPT model and an Azure AI Search index generated from your data, which is integrated into a web application to provide a natural language interface for search queries.

This repository provides a setting up the solution, along with detailed instructions on how to use and customize it to fit your specific needs.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: We will implement secure access through SSO, ensuring the necessary confidentiality and authentication. It will run as a Web App, accessible from both computers and mobile devices.

- **User profiling**: We will introduce a profiling system that allows users to access specific information based on their role type, whether it is to manage data input, explore the knowledge base, delete documentation, or configure the behavior of LLM models.

- **Integration with LLM models**: We will connect to various versions of LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 for generating responses using Azure Open AI Service as the main resource to provide robust, contextually relevant answers. Additionally, for the generation of embeddings, a connection is made with the Open AI model text-embedding-ada-002.

- **Responses with associated documentary references**: All generated responses will include cited sources, accessible through URL or download, ensuring transparency and accuracy of the provided information.

- **Centralized data repository**: Information will be stored in a single repository, facilitating access. Additionally, the loading of new documents and URL references will be allowed to enrich the knowledge base.

- **Conversational limit**: Initially, due to the number of test users, there will be no limits on the length of conversations, allowing detailed and complete interactions.

- **Conversation management**: A storage of conversations will be available, providing transparency and tracking throughout the interaction with the virtual agent. At the same time, the users will be capable to create a new conversation, delete/remove or download their saved conversations. During conversations, the user will experiment that the AI agent provide several followups questions generate automatically by the LLM using the previous context. 

- **Feedback storage**: A storage for the feedback provided by the user will be available, providing the possibility to build performance metrics and fine-tune QnA dataset.

- **Availability to configure the application**: The web app will have a page dedicated to allow the user personalize the main parameters of the solution such as: Model parameters, orchestrator, logging, prompting, document processors etc.

- **Evaluation metrics**: The solution performance will be displayed in the metrics page. This page will allow the user to consume the feedback as a report in different formats (.txt, .xlsx). The metrics will be divided in two main sections, Global Metrics, will be the measue of all users feedbacks and Local Metrics will be an individually feedback measure.

- **Possibility to create a user own knowledge base**: The solution will allow the users to upload their own documentation, that means that each user will have an own knowledge base to consult. This approach will generate for each user a dedicated Azure AI Search Index by user id (Azure AD)

- **Ingest, explore and delete data from knowledge base**: The solution will allow users to ingest new documents in a batch mode to the global knowledge base. Once the documents have been uploaded the users can explore the data indexed and also have the possibility to delete documents in a batch mode.

### Azure AI Search used as retriever in RAG

Azure AI Search, when used as a retriever in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, plays a key role in fetching relevant information from a large corpus of data. The RAG pattern involves two key steps: retrieval of documents and generation of responses. Azure AI Search, in the retrieval phase, filters and ranks the most relevant documents from the dataset based on a given query.

The importance of optimizing data in the index for relevance lies in the fact that the quality of retrieved documents directly impacts the generation phase. The more relevant the retrieved documents are, the more accurate and pertinent the generated responses will be.

Azure AI Search allows for fine-tuning the relevance of search results through features such as [scoring profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/index-add-scoring-profiles), which assign weights to different fields, [Lucene's powerful full-text search capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/query-lucene-syntax), [vector search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/vector-search-overview) for similarity search, multi-modal search, recommendations, [hybrid search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/hybrid-search-overview) and [semantic search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-get-started-semantic) to use AI from Microsoft to rescore search results and moving results that have more semantic relevance to the top of the list. By leveraging these features, one can ensure that the most relevant documents are retrieved first, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the RAG pattern.

Moreover, optimizing the data in the index also enhances the efficiency, the speed of the retrieval process and increases relevance which is an integral part of the RAG pattern.

### Chunking: Importance for RAG and strategies implemented as part of this repo

Chunking is essential for managing large data sets, optimizing relevance, preserving context, integrating workflows, and enhancing the user experience. See [How to chunk documents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-chunk-documents) for more information.

These are the chunking strategy options you can choose from:

- **Layout**: An AI approach to determine a good chunking strategy.

-  **Page**: This strategy involves breaking down long documents into pages.

The following methods haven't been tested in this product:

   - **Fixed-Size Overlap**: This strategy involves defining a fixed size that’s sufficient for semantically meaningful paragraphs (for example, 250 words) and allows for some overlap (for example, 10-25% of the content). This usually helps creating good inputs for embedding vector models. Overlapping a small amount of text between chunks can help preserve the semantic context.

   -  **Paragraph**: This strategy allows breaking down a difficult text into more manageable pieces and rewrite these “chunks” with a summarization of all of them.

## Supported file types

Out-of-the-box, you can upload the following file types:

* PDF
* TXT
* HTML
* MD (Markdown)
* DOCX
 
**NOTE**: *To upload documents such as pptx or xlsx to only way to do uploa them is convert them to PDF format.*

## Foundational components of this solution

### Resources used in this solution

Many of the components of this architecture are the same as the resources in the baseline app services web application, as the chat UI hosting in this architecture follows the baseline App Service web application's architecture. The components highlighted in this section focus on the components used to build and orchestrate chat flows, and data services and the services that expose the LLMs.

[Azure Function App](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/) as a prompt manager is a development tool that allows you to build, evaluate, and deploy flows that link user prompts, actions through Python code, and calls to LLMs. Azure function is used in this architecture as the layer that orchestrates flows between the prompt, different data stores, and the LLM. Azure Function endpoints allow to deploy a flow for real-time inference. In this architecture, they're used to as a PaaS endpoint for the chat UI to invoke the azure function prompt flows hosted by Azure Functions (PoC solution). For a production environment should  be consider a microservice solution using Azure Container resources such as AKS or Container Apps.

[Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/) is used to persist the prompt flow source files for prompt flow development.

[Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/) is a fully managed service that provides REST API access to Azure OpenAI's large language models, including the GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Embeddings set of models. In this architecture, in addition to model access, it's used to add common enterprise features such as virtual network and private link, managed identity support, and content filtering.

[Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/) is a cloud search service that supports full-text search, semantic search, vector search, and hybrid search. Azure AI Search is included in the architecture as It's a common service used in the flows behind chat applications. Azure AI Search can be used to retrieve and index data that is relevant for user queries. The prompt flow implements the RAG pattern Retrieval Augmented Generation to extract the appropriate query from the prompt, query AI Search, and use the results as grounding data for the Azure OpenAI model.

[Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/) Azure AI Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer) is a cloud-based Azure AI service that uses machine-learning models to automate your data processing in applications and workflows. Document Intelligence is essential for enhancing data-driven strategies and enriching document search capabilities.

[Azure Event Hub Namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/) Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native data streaming service that can stream millions of events per second, with low latency, from any source to any destination. Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka, and it enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without any code changes. Using Event Hubs to ingest and store streaming data, businesses can harness the power of streaming data to gain valuable insights, drive real-time analytics, and respond to events as they happen, enhancing overall efficiency and customer experience.

[Azure Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) Application Insights provides many experiences to enhance the performance, reliability, and quality of your applications. A real-time analytics dashboard for insight into application activity and performance. Trace and diagnose transactions to identify issues and optimize performance.

[Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/overview) Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server is a fully managed database service designed to provide more granular control and flexibility over database management features and configuration options. Overall, the service provides greater flexibility and customizations of server configuration based on user requirements. The flexible server architecture allows users to collocate the database engine with the client tier for low latency and opt for high availability within a single or multiple availability zones.

## Prerequisites to deploy this solution in Azure

* Azure subscription with contributor access.

* **Azure Open AI**

   An [Azure OpenAI resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) and a deployment for one of the following Chat model and an embedding model:

   * Chat Models
       * GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 (Deployment name gpt-35-turbo)
       * GPT-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 (Deployment name gpt-35-turbo-16k)
       * GPT-4-1106-Preview (Deployment name gpt-4)

   * Embedding Model 
      * text-embedding-ada-002 - 2 (Deployment name text-embedding-ada-002)

   * Models quotas

      Review the current quota configuration before do anything. Chat models need to be upper than < 60-80K (TPM) and embeddings models need to be upper than < 180-200K (TPM).
      
      According to embedding model quotas, is super important to know prior to uploading the document, consider various ingest strategies:

      - **Layout**: This entails uploading documentation that will be segmented on a per-page basis. Consequently, all information contained on each page will be acquired in its entirety. Recommended for documents with < 100 pages.

      - **Page**: This involves the upload of documentation segmented by page, with the additional subdivision of information on each page into smaller units, known as chunks. Two key parameters must be taken into consideration for this strategy: Chunk size (denoting the amount of information desired for each chunk) and Chunk overlap (indicating the amount of information to be retained between two chunks to mitigate potential information loss). Recommended for documents with > 100 pages.

      When determining the appropriate option, the default recommendation is to opt for the **Layout** strategy to optimize knowledge acquisition and circumvent potential disruptions in the presentation of tables, diagrams, etc., as long as the document intended for upload under this strategy does not surpass approximately 150 pages. This limitation is attributable to **Azure OpenAI quota restrictions**. For documents exceeding this page threshold > 100, the **Page** type chunking strategy becomes necessary.

      It will depend on the complexity of the documents. If it is a non-enriched document, which does not contain graphics, tables, etc., only plain text, the layout strategy could be used for documents with a larger number of pages between 100-200 pages.
   
   **NOTE**: The deployment template defaults to **gpt-4** and **text-embedding-ada-002**. If your deployment names are different, update them in the deployment process.

* **Azure Storage Account**

   * Containers name:
      - config - This container will have the global configuration of the application, is a .json file. This configuration file can be found in this directory: ./active.json
      - documents - This container will be the centralized data repository.
      - user-documents - This container will be the centralized data repository for users own documentation.
      - feedback - This container will be the centralized data repository for users feedbacks.

* **Azure AD Groups for user profiling need to be created by the project manager**

   * **Orai_Admin group**

      Access to:

      - Chat with finance, culture and banking strategy data.
      - Data ingest (pdf, docx, etc.).
      - Explore how your data was indexed.
      - Remove indexed data.
      - Review feedback metrics.
      - Tailor underlying prompts, logging settings and others.

   * **Orai_Advance group**
   
      Access to:

      - Chat with finance, culture and banking strategy data.
      - Data ingest (pdf, docx, etc.).

   * **Orai_Metrics group**
   
      Access to:

      - Chat with finance, culture and banking strategy data .
      - Review feedback metrics.

   * **Orai_User group**
   
      Access to:

      - Chat with finance, culture and bank strategy data.

* **Azure AI Search (RAG engine)**

   Ensure that the resource has non-encrypted indexes policy activated. By default, the Santander IT infrastructure template (IaC) has encrypted-indexes policy activated and enforced. At this moment, this solution need to use non-encrypted indexes. Contact to IT team to resolve this policy issue.

* **Azure Function Apps (Backend)**

   Configure the resource with the env variables in Azure Function App configuration tab.
   [Go to **environment variables backend section** in this readme to know which env variables the resource needs](#environment-variables)

   Once you have configured all the environment vraibles, go to **backend/BatchPushResults** function and edit function.json
   The field **eventHubName** must have the same value as EVENT_HUB_NAME environment variable.

   Ensure that Azure Functions App is linked to an Application Insights resource.
   
   By default, the Santander IT infrastructure template (IaC) has a runtime version error. Contact to IT team to resolve this 
   runtime issue. 

* **Authentication component**

   In order to consume the application within the code, the following credentials from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are required: CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, AZURE_TENANT_ID

   - **Create data base**: create database with name chat_history
   - **Create tables**: run the following script to create the necessary tables
   
      ```shell
      CREATE TABLE users (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         user_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,
         username VARCHAR(50),
         created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
      );
      
      CREATE TABLE conversations (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         conversation_id UUID UNIQUE NOT NULL,
         user_id UUID REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
         topic VARCHAR(200),

## Deployment with pipeline jenkins for DEV environment

When making an update in the development branch of git, a jenkins pipeline configured in git is executed. The pipeline follows the following steps: run unit tests, Sonar, Fortify, generate a package in Nexus, store active.json from git to the config container of the blob storage (this is only done if the active.json does not exist in the blob, if it exists it is not rewritten) and, finally, deploy to azure resources. 

The versioning control is found in the setup file.

**NOTE**: the procedure to follow to make changes to the active.json once deployed should be: 
   - Make the necessary modifications in the development environment.
   - Once you have the final version, take it to the PRE/PRO confing container blob storage
   - Update active.json in github

![A screenshot of the pipeline configuration.](media/pipeline.png)


## Generate version for PRE/PRO environment for DEV environment
To generate a version for the PRE/PRO environment it is necessary to go to jenkins, select "Build with Parameters", then select "IS_RELEASE" and click run. This will run a pipeline with the following steps: unit tests, sonar, fortify, merge the development branch into master, create a version tag, upload the version to Nexus, and increment the package's fix will be executed.

The versioning control is found in the setup file.

## Orai Roadmap

1. Update current langchain process to help the model to improve the processing of tables.

   Review strategies for processing images and tables in PDF's:
      - Document Intelligence will be used to analyze images, text and tables of documents (PDFs) as before.
      - The multi-vector retriever will be Azure AI Search to store text and images along with their summaries for retrieval.
      - GPT-4V for both image summarization (for retrieval) and synthesis of the final answer from the joint review of images and text (or tables)."

2. Add PPT and Excel document ingest support. Currently, the ingest process needs that the pptx has been converted beforehand. 

3. That when the VA has to answer with data or figures and years, it can give us the answer in table format or the most appropriate one depending on the answer.

4. Encrypted index for a possible production environment.

5. Analyze strategies in Azure to generate document access levels (Document Level Access Control) to configure the index with document access lists using Orai groups. Define well the whole issue of permissions, user profiling, etc..

6. Synchronization with IT team to review DEV and PRO (DevOps) environments (Review alternatives to replicate index from DEV to PRO).

7. Generate an evaluation dataset and implement an evaluation process to check the performance of the solution. With this process the idea will be to use it as a "check" to perform the deployments to production. 

8. Process monitoring to inform the user at least during document upload.

9. Awaiting information on Adobe's document platform to analize a document versioning process.
